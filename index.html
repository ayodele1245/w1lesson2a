            <h2>Educational Background</h2>
          <p><strong>I started my Primary School in the<i>year 1993</i></strong>. The journey was not as smooth as it used to be for some other kids.
            </p>
           <p>I started in a Government primary school but eventually crossed to a private school called <i>Adeyemi Memorial Nursery And Primary School in Oja Odan, Ogun State</i></p>
            <p>I was one of the prefects at the final year with the portfolio <i>Time Keeper</i></p>
          <p>
            In the year 2008, I moved to secondary school. The name of my secondary school is <strong>Orita Community High School</strong> located in Oja Odan
            The experience was awesome. I finished my secondary education in the year 2004.

          </p>
          <p>
            It took me six years before I got admission into the university. This was due to the fact that I insisted on studying Electrical Engineering.
            I graduated in year 2014 from 'The Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria.'
